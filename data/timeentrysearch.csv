I've been helping Ben Michael with performance issues that he has reported on his PC. Unfortunately, after taking a look at the issue, it seems that the biggest bottle neck on its performance is the lack of memory. At the moment, his machine, DESKTOP-4F9QQG5 (SN: NXGZRSM002839006766600) only has 4 GB of RAM. The lack of memory will mean that he is limited in how many applications and tabs in his web browser that he can have open at one time, and it will also cause his applications to occasionally freeze up.  For now, I've done what I can to keep the machine up to date and advised that he runs the minimal amount of apps/tabs at one time. The laptop is still usable, but these performance issues will likely persist. I would advise that the best course of action would be to provide a laptop that has at least 8 GB of memory.

Her laptop is only 1 year old and it is in warranty but it is not going to be up to the task of having all of this extra bloat on her PC. Therefore, I decided to do the following...  I closed all of the Google Chrome tabs. This reduced the memory usage to 80%.  I uninstalled McAfee LiveSafe.  I started the updates on her PC.  I advised her to reboot her PC when these updates are finished and the uninstallation was successful.

Good Morning Dan   I have been looking through your Office 365 this morning and can see that currently your emails route through Mimecast. As this is provided by Carden, we need to migrate you to directly route via Office 365 before they disable your Mimecast and potentially cause issues.   To complete this move, can you please let us know your login details for Godaddy (your DNS provider)? I would like to make this change at the end of today, (4-5 if possible), as I am then available tomorrow if there are any issues.   There are a couple of points to note,  While the change goes through, incoming emails maybe delayed as they reroute to Office 365.  We will need to train Office 365s spam filtering, as currently Mimecast has that role. You may see more spam for the first few days and some non-spam emails maybe caught until we can whitelist domains for you. We would suggest that you ask users the check their spam folder more often for the next week or two and let us know if legitimate emails are being flagged.  As part of this, we are going to create and edit some policies for security. Currently Mimecast is handling these policies, so they may require some training over the next few weeks.  I plan to enable some policies at the switch over time, but we will leave some for next month to make the changes as small as possible for users.  If you have any external email addresses that you have had issues with or regularly email and want to prevent issues, please feel free to send over a list and we can add them for you.   One last point I would like to bring up, this maybe a good time to ask all staff to visit https://aka.ms/mfasetup login and make sure that they have two MFA methods setup (phone number, email, MS phone App etc). We would like to enable a policy to force an MFA request whenever anyone logs into Office 365 external to your office.

Please note - I haven't had eyes on their Azure environment, so this information is based on an *Azure Proposal*, a review of their M365 environment and a 30 minute call with Dan & Richard.   Support Contract   Carden IT is their incumbent. They have been partnered with them for over 5 years now, but have never had a close relationship with them. They have recently completed an Azure Migration for Stratton and it has not gone smoothly. There have been several delays and a reluctance to assist with small roadblocks along the way.   Based on the number of Windows Devices & MS Teams Voice licenses, I believe there are around 40-45 endpoints in the business. I can't see that there are any macOS devices in the business. Please quote accordingly for MPS device count. I can't see what AV they are using, nothing is discovered in the Intune app reports and they are not licensed for M365 Defender for Endpoint. Either they have no AV installed, or Intune is not configured correctly.   Dan & Richard are looking to offload all IT tasks to a partner. Currently Richard is doing day to day support such as; assisting users with password resets and basic troubleshooting, creating new user accounts etc. Richard's time is better spent being a consultant in the business and should have a trusted partner for internal users to reach straight out to.   Having not done a deep dive into their infrastructure, it would be difficult to estimate support usage for you. However, it sounds like you want to sell proactive pre-pay so this shouldn't be an issue. I think the customer will have a better experience if they bought a normal managed agreement, as topping up support hours is a blocker to resolving support issues when they run out and usually introduces frustration into the relationship.   I believe 3 days of onboarding should be sufficient. They are cloud only, so review of infrastructure is simple as it is all in Azure. The rest of their LOB apps are SaaS, so again simple to get credentials and document in IT Glue. I don't believe at this time Auvik will add much value to their Trident experience so I wouldn't quote it. I think it is important that Dan & Richard have IT Glue access as the transparency around documentation and credentials will bolster the relationship. If this is a cost, it should be quoted.   M365   We've already discussed licensing; each user has M365 Business Standard, Exchange Online Plan 2 & Microsoft 365 F1. They are also a Teams Voice house, with call plans provided by Microsoft. I would suggest the below;    Uplift from M365 Business Standard to Premium  Remove M365 F1  Leave EOL P2 in-place (if Dan & Richard can confirm they are required for mailboxes larger than 50GB)  Migrate from Teams Voice call plans to Voiceflex as the cost will be lower   Their total Microsoft 365 bill will work out around the same and they will gain the below features;    Windows Autopilot  Defender for Endpoint (I wouldn't talk too much about this if you are selling MPS Full as S1 is direct compete)  Defender for Office 365  Shared Computer Activation - will be used if AVD ever implemented  Windows Hello for Business   Not only will new features be unlocked, but administration of the tenant is easier with less license sprawl.   Azure   Awaiting eyes on or proposal doc. Unsure of what is being hosted here.   On-premises Infrastructure   No site visit has been conducted so unable to provide information on networking kit at HQ.   CDP   Based off limited information (Azure review required to bulk out)    Deploy Autopilot  Reduce time it takes to get new machines to new/existing users. This will ...",Non-Billable
